# 🏙️ Madrid Rental Market Analysis

This project explores and analyzes the rental housing market in the Community of Madrid using real-world data extracted from Fotocasa. The goal is to build a compact, modular, and insightful pipeline that demonstrates skills in web scraping, data wrangling, geospatial analysis, and visualization — all within the scope of a realistic data science project.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Scrape rental listing data for Madrid from [Fotocasa](https://www.fotocasa.es)
- Clean and preprocess the dataset to normalize variables like price, size, and price per square meter
- Perform exploratory and geospatial analysis to understand trends and outliers in rental prices
- Create interactive maps and visuals that help compare prices across Madrid's neighborhoods and districts
- Modularize the project to ensure maintainability and reusability
